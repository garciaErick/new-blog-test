I have always been a really _opinionated_ individual, meaning that I have strong opinions how some things should or should not behave. Due to this I am always customizing whatever environment I will be interacting with. As a _software developer_, my Operating System and keyboard are my main tools and I never like to be limited by the things I am able to do. I like to think scripts / OS / keyboard / environments, to be an extension of my body, as such I should be able to control them as I please.

My previous keyboards the [Pok3r](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165) were programable but lacked the robustness and flexibility I wanted, it felt more like a hack. Finally after deciding whether or not I should spend another \$400 in a new MK (mechanical keyboard) I settled the [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/)'s products since it already comes with [Oryx](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx) an online interface and VCS for customizing your keyboard, and [Wally](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally) a tool to flash the board in your keyboard, and obviously your choice of mechanical keyboards in addition to its marketed ergonomical features.

One last thing I would like to address before going more in depth my keyboard layout is Vim

Without further ado I will give a tour explaining the features of my layout.
